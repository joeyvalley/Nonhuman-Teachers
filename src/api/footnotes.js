He was captured in Yukon Harbor, Washington, in October of 1968 and was the first whale kept at Sealand of the Pacific, where he lived there until his death in 1982.<br /><br />Sealand's research division began sound and communication experiments with it's whales in 1972. It was during this time that flautist Paul Horn was asked to participate by playing his flute to Haida. The two quickly developed a close relationship and understanding, communicating through music.<br /><br />A recording of their collaboration was made and released in 1972 by Sealand of the Pacific entitled <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/3020564-Haida-2-Paul-Horn-Haida-Paul-Horn-EP" target="_blank">Haida & Paul Horn</a>, featuring two tracks of original music and a spoken-word history of whales.<br /><br />Image credit: Sealand of the Pacific`
